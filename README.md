## üéØ Overview

This project successfully develops a custom object detection solution for drone footage captured from challenging inclined angles. Using YOLOv8n (nano), we created a lightweight model capable of accurately identifying vehicles, people, buildings, trees, and bushes from unique aerial perspectives.

**Key Achievement:** 48% mean Average Precision (mAP50) on validation set with a lightweight, deployable model.

## üö® Problem Statement

Standard pre-trained object detection models are typically trained on:
- Ground-level imagery
- High-altitude top-down views (remote sensing)

Our challenge was detecting objects in drone footage from **intermediate, inclined angles** - a perspective that existing models handle poorly. This required creating a custom dataset and training a specialized model.

### Target Classes
- üöó **Vehicle**: Cars, trucks, and other vehicles
- üë• **Person**: People in various poses and positions  
- üè¢ **Building**: Structures and buildings
- üå≥ **Tree**: Trees and large vegetation
- üåø **Bush**: Bushes and smaller vegetation

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom YOLOv8n Model**: Optimized for inclined-angle drone footage
- **Real-time Detection**: Lightweight model suitable for on-device deployment
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Frame-by-frame detection logs with timestamps
- **Data Augmentation Pipeline**: Robust dataset enhancement techniques
- **Video Processing**: Complete workflow from training to inference

## üìä Dataset

### Dataset Creation Process

#### Version 1 (Initial Dataset)
- 250+ manually annotated images extracted from drone video frames
- Manual annotation using Roboflow workspace
- Semi-automated labeling using trained model as "Roboflow bot"
- Maintained class balance across all target categories

#### Version 2 (Augmented Dataset)
- Enhanced dataset with aggressive data augmentation
- Applied transformations: tilt, rotation, translation, noise, blur
- Additional manual annotations for improved robustness
- Final training dataset used for production model

### Complete Code Implementation

#### `train.py` - Model Training Script
```python
# train.py
# This script trains a custom YOLOv8 model for object detection.

from ultralytics import YOLO

# --- 1. Load a Pre-trained Model ---
# Load the YOLOv8 Nano ('n') model. 'yolov8n.pt' contains weights pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
# This is the starting point for our custom training (transfer learning).
# The nano model is the smallest and fastest, ideal for devices with less compute power.
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

# --- 2. Train the Model on a Custom Dataset ---
# The train() method starts the training process.
results = model.train(
   data='data.yaml',        # Path to the dataset configuration file. This file tells YOLO where to find the
                           # training/validation images and what the class names are.
   epochs=100,              # The total number of times the model will cycle through the entire training dataset.
   imgsz=640,               # The input image size. All images will be resized to 640x640 pixels before
                           # being fed into the network.
   batch=16,                # The number of images to process in a single batch. A larger batch size can speed up
                           # training but requires more memory (VRAM).
   name='yolov8_custom',    # The name of the experiment. Results (weights, logs) will be saved in a
                           # directory named 'runs/detect/yolov8_custom'.
   workers=4                # The number of worker threads for loading data. Speeds up data preprocessing.
)

print("‚úÖ Training complete.")
```

#### `detect.py` - Detection/Inference Script
```python
# detect.py
# This script uses the trained custom YOLOv8 model to perform object detection on a video file.
# It saves the output as a new video with bounding boxes and creates a text log of all detections.

import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO

# --- 1. Initialization ---

# Load the custom-trained YOLOv8 model.
# 'best.pt' is the model file with the best validation performance from our training session.
model = YOLO("runs/detect/yolov8_custom/weights/best.pt")

# Define the input video path and open it using OpenCV.
video_path = "input.mp4"
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

# Get video properties (FPS, width, height) to create the output video correctly.
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
frame_number = 0

# Set up the VideoWriter object to save the output video.
# 'mp4v' is the codec for the .mp4 format.
out = cv2.VideoWriter("output_video.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"mp4v"), fps, (width, height))

# Open a log file in write mode to store detection details.
log_file = open("detections_log.txt", "w")

print("üé¨ Starting detection on video...")

# --- 2. Main Processing Loop ---
while True:
    # Read one frame from the video. 'ret' is True if a frame was read successfully.
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break  # Exit the loop if the video has ended.

    # --- Perform Inference ---
    # Pass the frame to the model for detection. `verbose=False` keeps the console clean.
    # `[0]` selects the detection results for the first (and only) image.
    results = model(frame, verbose=False)[0]
    annotated_frame = frame.copy() # Create a copy to draw on, leaving the original intact.

    # --- Process and Log Detections ---
    detections = []
    # Iterate through each detected bounding box in the results.
    for box in results.boxes:
        cls_id = int(box.cls)            # Get the class ID (e.g., 0 for 'person').
        conf = float(box.conf)           # Get the confidence score of the detection.
        label = model.names[cls_id]      # Get the class name from the model's metadata.
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box.xyxy[0]) # Get the bounding box coordinates.

        # Draw the bounding box on the frame.
        cv2.rectangle(annotated_frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)

        # Add the detection info to our list for logging.
        detections.append(f"{label} ({conf:.2f})")

    # --- Write to Log File ---
    timestamp = frame_number / fps # Calculate the timestamp in seconds.
    if detections:
        line = f"Frame {frame_number}, Time {timestamp:.2f}s: " + ", ".join(detections)
    else:
        line = f"Frame {frame_number}, Time {timestamp:.2f}s: No objects detected"
    
    log_file.write(line + "\n")
    print(line) # Also print the log line to the console for real-time feedback.

    # --- Display and Save Frame ---
    # Display the frame with detections in a window.
    cv2.imshow("YOLOv8 Detection", annotated_frame)
    # Save the annotated frame to the output video file.
    out.write(annotated_frame)
    
    frame_number += 1
    
    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed.
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

print("‚úÖ Detection and logging complete.")
cap.release()
out.release()
